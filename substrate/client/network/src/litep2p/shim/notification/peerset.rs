//! It is these state transitions that are

//! `Peerset` deals with two types of peers:

/// Opening and closing are separate states as litep2p guarantees to report when the substream is
/// either fully open or fully closed and the slot allocation for opening a substream is tied to a
/// state transition which moves the peer to [`PeerState::Opening`]. This is because it allows
/// reserving a slot for peer to prevent infinite outbound substreams. If the substream is opened
/// successfully, peer is moved to state [`PeerState::Open`] but there is no modificatoin to the
/// slot count as an outbound slot was already allocated for the peer. If the substream fails to
/// open, the event is reported by litep2p and [`Peerset::report_substream_open_failure()`] is
/// called which will decrease the outbound slot count. Similarly for inbound streams, the slot is
/// allocated in [`Peerset::report_inbound_substream()`] which will prevent `Peerset` from accepting
/// infinite inbound substreams. If the inbound substream fails to open and since [`Peerset`] was
/// notified of it, litep2p will report the open failure and the inbound slot count is once again
/// decreased in [`Peerset::report_substream_open_failure()`]. If the substream is opened
/// successfully, the slot count is not modified.
///
/// Since closing a substream is not instantaneous, there is a separate [`PeersState::Closing`]
/// state which indicates that the substream is being closed but hasn't been closed by litep2p yet.
/// This state is used to prevent invalid state transitions where, for example, [`Peerset`] would
/// close a substream and then try to reopen it immediately.
///
/// Irrespective of which side closed the substream (local/remote), the substream is chilled for a
/// small amount of time ([`DEFAULT_BACKOFF`]) and during this time no inbound or outbound
/// substreams are accepted/established. Inbound subtreams are completely rejected and outbound
/// substream requests are put on hold. Once the backoff expires and if the local node is still
/// interested in opening an outbound substream (the request hasn't been canceled), outbound
/// substream request is made to litep2p.
///
/// Disconnections and open failures will contribute negatively to the peer score to prevent it from
